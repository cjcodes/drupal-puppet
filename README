Drupalboxes Puppet Modules
==========================

A handy set of Puppet modules for managing Drupal and the LAMP stack.

To make use of the modules, make sure they're in your Puppet module path, and
include them in your manifests.

The classes are designed to be easy to re-use, and the 'params' classes are
designed to be instantiated with parameters that override basic configuration
for the module.
